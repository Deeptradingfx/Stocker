	"bloomberg+news": "Blue Apron Holdings Inc. is closing a New Jersey facility and moving 1,270 jobs to a bigger site opening in the state later this year. More than half of the employees at the Jersey City facility have decided to move to Linden, New Jersey, a company spokeswoman said. According to a public notice, the original Jersey City fulfillment center will close by October. Workers notified Friday of the changes will still have the opportunity to relocate to the new warehouse, the spokeswoman said. A W.A.R.N. notice, which requires employers to provide 60 days notice of plant closings and mass layoffs, appeared Friday saying that 1,270 Blue Apron employees would be affected. That represents about 24 percent of the company’s workforce. Blue Apron subsequently explained that the positions were being moved to another facility. The announcement comes about one month after the meal kit company went public. Last week, the company restructured its executive team. Chief Operating Officer Matt Wadiak -- who was also a co-founder -- stepped down from his role. The shares fell 6.1 percent to $5.84 at 3:22 p.m. in New York. They were down more than 35 percent since the IPO through Thursday. Meal kits, a relatively new phenomenon, make up less than 1 percent of total U.S. food purchases and have yet to prove they’re more than a niche market. Blue Apron competes with dozens of other such startups, including Hello Fresh, and Plated, while Amazon.com Inc. has also shown it’s interested in getting in. Blue Apron has had to spend heavily on marketing just to educate consumers about the product and distinguish itself. In February, Blue Apron said it expected to need 2,000 workers for the Linden facility when it opens and will continue to hire to meet its needs after that. Blue Apron had a total of 5,202 workers as of March 31, according to company documents. Most of the employees sort, clean and assemble food into boxes that correspond with recipes for making dinner at home. The Linden facility, at 500,000 square feet (46,452 square meters), will be the company’s biggest and will include better automation technology. It’s part of Blue Apron’s expansion strategy, including rolling out more product options. Blue Apron also plans to open another facility in 2018 in Fairfield, California. Even as Blue Apron seeks to expand, analysts and investors are expressing concern about Amazon.com Inc. The e-commerce giant announced it was buying grocery chain Whole Foods Market Inc. just days before Blue Apron’s IPO, forcing it to reduce its offering price by 34 percent. (Updates with shares in the fourth paragraph. A previous version of this story was corrected to clarify that the positions being eliminated are being moved to another facility.)",

									AUSTIN, Texas -- August 1, 2017

									Marathon Kids and Nike are proud to announce that as of this summer, kids in
									50 states across the U.S. are now running with Marathon Kids. The goal-driven
									running program challenges kids to run the equivalent of up to four marathons
									(104.8 miles) over the course of a running club season or school year.

									Marathon Kids began over 22 years ago in Austin, Tex., and expanded to Calif.
									and Md. in its first two decades. In 2015, Marathon Kids and Nike joined
									forces, and the partnership has grown the program from three states to all 50
									states, with more than 350,000 kids running in the program with their local
									community-based organizations, schools or at home with their families.

									With the goal of inspiring half a million kids in the U.S. to start running
									with the program by 2020, Marathon Kids expanded its reach with Marathon Kids
									at Home in 2016. The four-marathon challenge is the same as the traditional
									program, with Marathon Kids at Home enabling families to run together, using
									the Marathon Kids motivational mobile app to track the progress of their
									running season and celebrate accomplishing milestones along the way.

									“Our goal is to get kids running for life—for their health and happiness now,
									and for a lifetime,” said Ray Blue, Chief Development Officer. “The
									partnership with Nike has really taken our program to the next level, and
									we’re so humbled and excited by the potential to encourage even more kids to
									get active this summer with the Marathon Kids at Home program.”

									To celebrate the journey of getting kids moving in 50 states, Marathon Kids
									and Nike have also released a special short film, “Run With Me”, with Marathon
									Kids participants from across the country motivating other kids to get
									active—one mile at a time. The two-minute film shows how running can be fun,
									inclusive and empowering for all kids.

									“Today’s kids are part of the least active generation ever, and it’s up to all
									of us to get them moving,” said Caitlin Morris, General Manager of Nike Global
									Community Impact. “Nike believes in the power of sport to move the world,
									starting with kids, and there’s no better place to start than with running,
									the starting line for play and movement, to help them fall in love with sport
									and physical activity for a lifetime. Together with the Marathon Kids team,
									we’re excited to inspire kids across the country to participate in the
									program—running at school, in their neighborhoods and with their families—to
									help inspire positive habits that will benefit them in all areas of their
									life.”

									The Marathon Kids program design is informed by the research of leading
									physical activity experts at the University of Texas School of Public Health.
									Through an evidence-based approach, Marathon Kids has determined that an
									average child can safely and effectively meet the goal of running 104.8 miles,
									incrementally, over the course of a 3- 6- or 9-month running club season (or
									school year). A key part of the program is to provide positive reinforcement,
									which Marathon Kids does by rewarding kids with exclusive Nike program rewards
									when they reach program milestones of 26.2, 52.4, 78.6 and 104.8.

									By the end of the 2016-2017 running season, 80 percent of surveyed running
									clubs showed remarkable progress—with 89 percent of runners finishing one
									marathon, 72 percent finishing two marathons, 57 percent finishing three
									marathons and 41 percent completing all four marathons.

									The Marathon Kids at Home program makes it easy for families to get moving
									together— sign ups are available on the Marathon Kids website. The cost of the
									Marathon Kids program is $15 per person plus $5 for shipping and provides all
									the tools, incentives and motivation to start a family running club, including
									a family guide, mileage logs, rewards, access to additional online resources,
									trainings and events. Family running clubs can also use the Marathon Kids app
									(integrated with NIKE+) to track their miles.

									Here are a few inspiring examples of kids running with Marathon Kids across
									the country:

									  * One of Marathon Kids’ most active families, the Gonzalez family, began
									    participating in the program in the fall of 2015 in Los Angeles, Calif.
									    Omar Gonzalez learned about Marathon Kids through running with Nike and
									    the program quickly became part of his family’s routine. Together, they’ve
									    run in the last two Marathon Kids Miler celebratory events in LA and
									    continue on their fitness journey with the Marathon Kids at Home program.
									    Recently, Good Housekeeping shared their running story, which inspired mom
									    and daughter team Jessica and Amelia, from Casper, Wyo., to become
									    Marathon Kids' newest family run club. After reading the article, Jessica
									    knew the program would be a great fit for her and Amelia (8) who are
									    Wyoming’s first Marathon Kids runners as the 50^th state to join the
									    program. \"I want my daughter to grow up knowing that being active is not a
									    chore, but something she enjoys,” shares Jessica. “She's already an active
									    child but Marathon Kids has given us the opportunity to carve out time for
									    the two of us to spend together working on our running goals.\"
									  * At Oakhaven Elementary in Memphis, Tenn., 95 percent of kids are
									    economically disadvantaged, but thanks to special funding they were able
									    to bring in Marathon Kids as their first-ever extracurricular physical
									    activity program. During the school year their coach, Jeremiah Bland, uses
									    the program to teach hard work both on the track and in the classroom.
									    Most of his participants made the Honor Role and Principal's List while
									    logging the fastest 5K times in the county.
									  * Marathon Kids began in 1995 with just 2,000 kids from the 80,000+ Austin
									    Independent School District. The program's popularity quickly grew
									    statewide with hundreds of clubs in Dallas, Houston, Lubbock, the Rio
									    Grande Valley and waiting lists forming in other cities. This year more
									    than 100,000 Tex. children ran, maintaining its status as the state with
									    the highest Marathon Kids participation numbers.

	"yahoofinance+news": 		"Blue Apron APRN, one of the newest stocks on Wall Street, simply can’t stand the heat. The meal kit delivery service company tanked again on Tuesday, slipping further below its IPO price after one of the first significant analyst price targets was announced.

								Shares of Blue Apron fell 6.88% in morning trading Tuesday. Today’s downward movement comes after Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research gave the fledgling public company a $2 price target. The low price point comes in $8 below its $10 opening price point, which was already far lower than the initial $15 to $17 per share price Blue Apron hoped to go public at.

								In his note, Cerankosky wrote that Blue Apron’s sales growth is dependent on discounts, which he sees as a highly unstable, non-growth business model. He also mentioned that high labor and shipping costs might negatively impact the meal delivery company.

								One of the first big Wall Street “sell” signals is the latest in a string of blows to Blue Apron in its early days on the stock market. The company is already one of the worst performing 2017 IPOs year-to-date.

								\"The trading on this has been just awful,\" Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital, told CNBC last week. \"Some of it is the Amazon fear but that's not the only thing. Some of it is the IPO market itself. Investors are jumpy around valuation.\"

								Amazon’s AMZN planed acquisition of Whole Foods WFM, which was announced right before Blue Apron’s IPO, has contributed to the company’s early woes. The fear is that the size and scope of Amazon’s gigantic delivery service, which already includes food, will easily be able to outstretch Blue Apron’s reach with Whole Foods in its portfolio.

								On top of the potential Amazon and Whole Foods impact, Blue Apron’s customer retention rate has proved worrisome. According to a recent Motley Fool report, 50% of Blue Apron customers placed a second order the week after their first order. However, after 24 months, the customer retention rate falls to just 10%.

								More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like Run

								Did you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007? Now 2017 looks to be a pivotal year to get in on another emerging technology expected to rock the market. Demand could soar from almost nothing to $42 billion by 2025. Reports suggest it could save 10 million lives per decade, which could in turn save $200 billion in U.S. healthcare costs.

								A bonus Zacks Special Report names this breakthrough and the 8 best stocks to exploit it. Like Apple in 2007, these companies are already strong and coiling for potential mega-gains. Click to see them right now >>
