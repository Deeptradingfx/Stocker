	"bloomberg+news": "Blue Apron Holdings Inc. is closing a New Jersey facility and moving 1,270 jobs to a bigger site opening in the state later this year. More than half of the employees at the Jersey City facility have decided to move to Linden, New Jersey, a company spokeswoman said. According to a public notice, the original Jersey City fulfillment center will close by October. Workers notified Friday of the changes will still have the opportunity to relocate to the new warehouse, the spokeswoman said. A W.A.R.N. notice, which requires employers to provide 60 days notice of plant closings and mass layoffs, appeared Friday saying that 1,270 Blue Apron employees would be affected. That represents about 24 percent of the company’s workforce. Blue Apron subsequently explained that the positions were being moved to another facility. The announcement comes about one month after the meal kit company went public. Last week, the company restructured its executive team. Chief Operating Officer Matt Wadiak -- who was also a co-founder -- stepped down from his role. The shares fell 6.1 percent to $5.84 at 3:22 p.m. in New York. They were down more than 35 percent since the IPO through Thursday. Meal kits, a relatively new phenomenon, make up less than 1 percent of total U.S. food purchases and have yet to prove they’re more than a niche market. Blue Apron competes with dozens of other such startups, including Hello Fresh, and Plated, while Amazon.com Inc. has also shown it’s interested in getting in. Blue Apron has had to spend heavily on marketing just to educate consumers about the product and distinguish itself. In February, Blue Apron said it expected to need 2,000 workers for the Linden facility when it opens and will continue to hire to meet its needs after that. Blue Apron had a total of 5,202 workers as of March 31, according to company documents. Most of the employees sort, clean and assemble food into boxes that correspond with recipes for making dinner at home. The Linden facility, at 500,000 square feet (46,452 square meters), will be the company’s biggest and will include better automation technology. It’s part of Blue Apron’s expansion strategy, including rolling out more product options. Blue Apron also plans to open another facility in 2018 in Fairfield, California. Even as Blue Apron seeks to expand, analysts and investors are expressing concern about Amazon.com Inc. The e-commerce giant announced it was buying grocery chain Whole Foods Market Inc. just days before Blue Apron’s IPO, forcing it to reduce its offering price by 34 percent. (Updates with shares in the fourth paragraph. A previous version of this story was corrected to clarify that the positions being eliminated are being moved to another facility.)",

									AUSTIN, Texas -- August 1, 2017

									Marathon Kids and Nike are proud to announce that as of this summer, kids in
									50 states across the U.S. are now running with Marathon Kids. The goal-driven
									running program challenges kids to run the equivalent of up to four marathons
									(104.8 miles) over the course of a running club season or school year.

									Marathon Kids began over 22 years ago in Austin, Tex., and expanded to Calif.
									and Md. in its first two decades. In 2015, Marathon Kids and Nike joined
									forces, and the partnership has grown the program from three states to all 50
									states, with more than 350,000 kids running in the program with their local
									community-based organizations, schools or at home with their families.

									With the goal of inspiring half a million kids in the U.S. to start running
									with the program by 2020, Marathon Kids expanded its reach with Marathon Kids
									at Home in 2016. The four-marathon challenge is the same as the traditional
									program, with Marathon Kids at Home enabling families to run together, using
									the Marathon Kids motivational mobile app to track the progress of their
									running season and celebrate accomplishing milestones along the way.

									“Our goal is to get kids running for life—for their health and happiness now,
									and for a lifetime,” said Ray Blue, Chief Development Officer. “The
									partnership with Nike has really taken our program to the next level, and
									we’re so humbled and excited by the potential to encourage even more kids to
									get active this summer with the Marathon Kids at Home program.”

									To celebrate the journey of getting kids moving in 50 states, Marathon Kids
									and Nike have also released a special short film, “Run With Me”, with Marathon
									Kids participants from across the country motivating other kids to get
									active—one mile at a time. The two-minute film shows how running can be fun,
									inclusive and empowering for all kids.

									“Today’s kids are part of the least active generation ever, and it’s up to all
									of us to get them moving,” said Caitlin Morris, General Manager of Nike Global
									Community Impact. “Nike believes in the power of sport to move the world,
									starting with kids, and there’s no better place to start than with running,
									the starting line for play and movement, to help them fall in love with sport
									and physical activity for a lifetime. Together with the Marathon Kids team,
									we’re excited to inspire kids across the country to participate in the
									program—running at school, in their neighborhoods and with their families—to
									help inspire positive habits that will benefit them in all areas of their
									life.”

									The Marathon Kids program design is informed by the research of leading
									physical activity experts at the University of Texas School of Public Health.
									Through an evidence-based approach, Marathon Kids has determined that an
									average child can safely and effectively meet the goal of running 104.8 miles,
									incrementally, over the course of a 3- 6- or 9-month running club season (or
									school year). A key part of the program is to provide positive reinforcement,
									which Marathon Kids does by rewarding kids with exclusive Nike program rewards
									when they reach program milestones of 26.2, 52.4, 78.6 and 104.8.

									By the end of the 2016-2017 running season, 80 percent of surveyed running
									clubs showed remarkable progress—with 89 percent of runners finishing one
									marathon, 72 percent finishing two marathons, 57 percent finishing three
									marathons and 41 percent completing all four marathons.

									The Marathon Kids at Home program makes it easy for families to get moving
									together— sign ups are available on the Marathon Kids website. The cost of the
									Marathon Kids program is $15 per person plus $5 for shipping and provides all
									the tools, incentives and motivation to start a family running club, including
									a family guide, mileage logs, rewards, access to additional online resources,
									trainings and events. Family running clubs can also use the Marathon Kids app
									(integrated with NIKE+) to track their miles.

									Here are a few inspiring examples of kids running with Marathon Kids across
									the country:

									  * One of Marathon Kids’ most active families, the Gonzalez family, began
									    participating in the program in the fall of 2015 in Los Angeles, Calif.
									    Omar Gonzalez learned about Marathon Kids through running with Nike and
									    the program quickly became part of his family’s routine. Together, they’ve
									    run in the last two Marathon Kids Miler celebratory events in LA and
									    continue on their fitness journey with the Marathon Kids at Home program.
									    Recently, Good Housekeeping shared their running story, which inspired mom
									    and daughter team Jessica and Amelia, from Casper, Wyo., to become
									    Marathon Kids' newest family run club. After reading the article, Jessica
									    knew the program would be a great fit for her and Amelia (8) who are
									    Wyoming’s first Marathon Kids runners as the 50^th state to join the
									    program. \"I want my daughter to grow up knowing that being active is not a
									    chore, but something she enjoys,” shares Jessica. “She's already an active
									    child but Marathon Kids has given us the opportunity to carve out time for
									    the two of us to spend together working on our running goals.\"
									  * At Oakhaven Elementary in Memphis, Tenn., 95 percent of kids are
									    economically disadvantaged, but thanks to special funding they were able
									    to bring in Marathon Kids as their first-ever extracurricular physical
									    activity program. During the school year their coach, Jeremiah Bland, uses
									    the program to teach hard work both on the track and in the classroom.
									    Most of his participants made the Honor Role and Principal's List while
									    logging the fastest 5K times in the county.
									  * Marathon Kids began in 1995 with just 2,000 kids from the 80,000+ Austin
									    Independent School District. The program's popularity quickly grew
									    statewide with hundreds of clubs in Dallas, Houston, Lubbock, the Rio
									    Grande Valley and waiting lists forming in other cities. This year more
									    than 100,000 Tex. children ran, maintaining its status as the state with
									    the highest Marathon Kids participation numbers.

	"yahoofinance+news": 		"Blue Apron APRN, one of the newest stocks on Wall Street, simply can’t stand the heat. The meal kit delivery service company tanked again on Tuesday, slipping further below its IPO price after one of the first significant analyst price targets was announced.

								Shares of Blue Apron fell 6.88% in morning trading Tuesday. Today’s downward movement comes after Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research gave the fledgling public company a $2 price target. The low price point comes in $8 below its $10 opening price point, which was already far lower than the initial $15 to $17 per share price Blue Apron hoped to go public at.

								In his note, Cerankosky wrote that Blue Apron’s sales growth is dependent on discounts, which he sees as a highly unstable, non-growth business model. He also mentioned that high labor and shipping costs might negatively impact the meal delivery company.

								One of the first big Wall Street “sell” signals is the latest in a string of blows to Blue Apron in its early days on the stock market. The company is already one of the worst performing 2017 IPOs year-to-date.

								\"The trading on this has been just awful,\" Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital, told CNBC last week. \"Some of it is the Amazon fear but that's not the only thing. Some of it is the IPO market itself. Investors are jumpy around valuation.\"

								Amazon’s AMZN planed acquisition of Whole Foods WFM, which was announced right before Blue Apron’s IPO, has contributed to the company’s early woes. The fear is that the size and scope of Amazon’s gigantic delivery service, which already includes food, will easily be able to outstretch Blue Apron’s reach with Whole Foods in its portfolio.

								On top of the potential Amazon and Whole Foods impact, Blue Apron’s customer retention rate has proved worrisome. According to a recent Motley Fool report, 50% of Blue Apron customers placed a second order the week after their first order. However, after 24 months, the customer retention rate falls to just 10%.

	"seekingalpha+article": "	Summary

								Some are speculating that a General Electric break up is imminent.

								I beg to differ. A General Electric break up is off the table for several reasons.

								In the following piece I divulge why a break will not happen for concerned dividend growth and income investors.



								What Happened?

								New General Electric (NYSE: GE) CEO John Flannery took over the reins of the global goliath on August 1, 2017. The new CEO stated:

								\"I have a relentless focus, customers, team and execution/accountability. When we bring those three things together, we will create 'our GE.'\"
								In the letter, Flannery said he also met with 100 investors over the past month and hears them \"loud and clear\" on their concerns.

								\"They understand how massive the portfolio transformation has been since 2001, but now we need an intense focus on running the company well.\"
								I like the sound of that. Furthermore, it sounds to me like a break up is completely off the table by the implications of this remark. Many are calling for and/or postulating a break up was imminent based on General Electric’s continuously poor performance.

								Perennially poor performance

								General Electric's extremely poor performance was spotlighted recently with Jeff Immelt stepping down. There was much debate regarding this development. Many have stated Immelt's poor decision making and penchant for over promising and under-delivering are the primary culprits for the company's under-performance.

								Others state it was out of Immelt’s control. That the collection of unrelated business segments will never all be firing on all cylinders in unison. Furthermore, some suggest the sum of the parts is greater than the whole. Additionally, there is value to be derived from spinning off the individual business units. In either case, some believe the best way to create shareholder value may be to break the company up at this point. A recent article stated:

								“Shareholders would get the most value possible from a complete break-up of General Electric into multiple new spin-offs.”
								I am not so sure and General Electric’s new CEO seemed to put the kibosh on the idea with his statement on August 1st. Furthermore, in a statement emailed to CNBC, General Electric stated:

								\"Break-up shouldn't be part of the discussion. Over the next few months, John will perform a focused review on all aspects of the company. We will continue to take actions that deliver value to GE share-owners. John will focus ... on execution and accountability, both internally and externally, short-term and long-term.\"
								The one theme throughout the transformation has been General Electric’s size, strength and diversified business units are synergistic in nature. Yet, the supposed strength has been a curse over the last few quarters with one unit always seeming to pull down EPS.

								Is supposed strength actually a curse?

								It may be, yet it also provides a margin of security by providing cash flows from diversified revenue streams. What’s more, General Electric's massive size and scale is a huge plus for the company. The company is well positioned to leverage its current global footprint and diversified business units to stay one step ahead of the competition by having boots on the ground across the globe. This is referred to as the GE Store.


								Source: ge.com

								This global corporate structure is synergistic in nature as it creates an ecosystem of productivity through industrial analytics and software. Unfortunately, that hasn't completely come to fruition as of yet.

								In fact, under Immelt's control the company more closely resembles a good game of whack-a-mole than anything else. Immelt seemed one step behind the curve at each turn.



								Immelt sold out of the banking business at the lows, bought into the oil and gas business at the highs, and invested in global businesses just as President Trump's decidedly protectionist regime takes control. This has led many to believe the best way to create shareholder wealth may ultimately be a breakup of the company. I do not see it happening.

								The Bottom Line

								General Electric has under-performed the market for the entirety of Immelt's tenure. He has had his three strikes and now he is out. Nonetheless, Immelt's exit will not solve all of General Electric's problems. CEO Joihn Flannery has some work to do. Fortunately, expectations have been set so low at this point the only way to go may be up. What’s more, despite all the headwinds the company has had to absorb, General Electric's stock is up substantially over the last five years and returned billions to shareholders in the form of dividend and buybacks.

								I say General Electric has much more upside ahead of it than downside. The risk/reward equation for dividend growth and income investors favors staying long at this point. The company presently yields a predictable and safe dividend yielding 3.76%. What's more, all the bad news is out while several key catalysts for the stock remain intact. This creates an excellent total return opportunity in the stock. The saying goes buy low, sell high not the other way around. Nonetheless, I would layer into any position over time to reduce risk. Those are my thoughts on the matter. I look forward to reading yours.

								Your input is required!

								The most value from my articles is derived from the insightful comments provided by prescient Seeking Alpha members in the comments section below. Thank you in advance for your participation.

								Will simply replacing Immelt with Flannery solve all of General Electric's problems?

								Does the company need to break up entirely to unleash shareholder value?

						(Reuters) - Under Armour Inc (UAA.N), which became a sensation riding the athleisure trend a few years ago, laid out a strategy this week to stanch a steep decline in sales growth but the company's progress could hit roadblocks.

						The company admitted that its days of astronomical growth were behind them and said it would cut jobs and close stores, underscoring its struggles in a fast-changing and fiercely competitive U.S. sportswear market.

						\"We are not standing still,\" Chief Executive Kevin Plank said on a post-earnings call.

						Under Armour has set its sights on turning around sales with more affordable apparel and women's wear, stylish lifestyle products, a more substantial online presence, and greater speed getting its products to shelves.

						The company, however, could be spreading itself too thin, analysts said.

						Under Armour's troubles are partly tied to the fading athleisure trend - casual clothing designed for both exercise and everyday wear.

						But there are bigger problems afoot.

						Under Armour has only one hit shoe line: Stephen Curry. That carried the company's sales for three years, but demand for the latest collection, Curry 3, has been underwhelming.

						Rivals Nike Inc (NKE.N) and Adidas AG (ADSGn.DE), which have many successful lines, can sell their products at various price points at different outlets - department stores, sporting goods retailers and online - reaching more buyers.

						Under Armour hasn't been able to match that reach even as bankruptcies of several sporting goods chains such as Sports Authority have eliminated key distribution channels.

						To compensate, Under Armour has inked deals with Kohl's Corp (KSS.N), DSW Inc (DSW.N) and Famous Footwear, but analysts said it was too early to tell whether these steps were working.

						TOO ATHLETIC

						Adidas, which has been pouring cash into its U.S. business and pulling ahead of rivals, on Thursday reported another quarter of bumper sales growth. Nike last month posted a slight increase in quarterly sales even as North America sales stayed flat.

						Under Armour posted a 9 percent sales increase in its latest quarter, a far cry from its average growth rate of 20 percent between 2014 and 2016.

						Adding to the company's woes is the fact that shoppers view Under Armour as a brand catering to athletes rather than average Joes.

						\"With Under Armour it's more of like a sport; more of a basketball, on-court kind of feel and look. With Nike and Adidas, they make it so urban for everyone to wear,\" said Alanzo Jones, a shopper at a Manhattan Foot Locker store.

						The company is trying to shake off this image but its choice of endorsers - tennis ace Andy Murray and pro golfer Jordan Spieth among other athletes - isn't helping.

						Adidas and Nike, on the other hand, have signed on celebrities such as Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid: models with millions of Instagram followers and a hit with the young crowd.




						Some things, however, are out of Under Armour's control.

						Adidas and Nike have cashed in on the recent retro trend, selling yesteryear favorites Superstars and Air Jordans. But for Under Armour, a young company selling shoes for merely a decade, the trend is out of bounds.

						For now, everyone agrees that Under Armour needs to be more than a one-hit wonder.

						\"Steph Curry can do his part, he can keep wearing the shoe and keep winning Championships with his team, but at the end of the day if the shoe is not evolving ... they're going to get nowhere in that market,\" said A-Line partners analyst Gabriella Santaniello.

						The recent sell-off in the shares of traditional food industry middlemen is an overreaction to Amazon.com's moves into the sector, according to research analysts at Wells Fargo.

						The firm's favorite food distributor stocks remain Sysco Corp. (SYY

						51.42

						) and Performance Food Group Co. (PFCG), dubbed the “Big 3.” The analysts reiterated their outperform ratings on SSY and USFD, expecting solid results from all three food industry players, even with more cautious investor sentiment around the group. Since mid-June, investors have taken to the sidelines on food stocks, concerned over gross margin headwinds from input costs and the long-term implications of ecommerce giant Amazon’s entrance into the segment.

						While analyst Zachery Fadem expects gross margins to take a short-term hit, he suggests that inflation returning is a long-term net positive for food distributors. (See also: Amazon Surpasses $500B Mark, Bezos Briefly Becomes the World’s Richest Person.)

						Big 3 Benefits
						“Despite sequential deceleration, we model gross margins to remain positive, as: 1) Approximately half of Big 3 customers are on a contract (typically cost plus a fixed margin % or $), which treats inflation as a pass through; 2) mix benefits from local customer + PL growth serve as offsets; and 3) revenue mgmt. has improved, which uses customer data to set price guardrails to better manage market based pricing in inflationary/deflationary periods,” explained Fadem.

						Forecasting industry fundamentals to continue favoring the Big 3, the Wells Fargo analysts sees a buying opportunity following Amazon’s bid for natural grocer Whole Foods Market Inc. (WFM
						Whole Foods Market Inc
						WFM
						41.77
						-0.23%

						“Since the AMZN/WFM announcement (6/16), SYY (-5.5% vs. +2% SPX) and USFD (-3%) shares have reacted poorly, and we see opportunity with solid results. We believe the selloff owes primarily to the potential threat of AMZN gaining a more localized presence and infringing on a higher margin local customer base,” wrote Fadem. “We view the market reaction as misunderstood for several reasons (infrastructure limitations, customer relationships, few benefits to AMZN’s margins and/or Prime penetration, etc.), and see current valuations as attractive entry points for an industry with stable fundamentals, secular tailwinds, and scale player advantages.” (See also: Amazon Gives Few Hints on Whole Foods Acquisition.)

						It's hard to complain about many of the recent moves GoPro Inc.  (GPRO) has made to stabilize sales and narrow its losses. But as the company gets set to deliver its Q2 earnings report on Thursday afternoon, it looks as if the end result of all this maneuvering could simply be to let GoPro carve out a niche as a provider of hardware for action sports, outdoors and drone enthusiasts, rather than a mass-market consumer electronics firm.

						The good news: After falling 27% in 2016 to $1.19 billion, GoPro's sales have been rebounding a bit. Sales rose 19% annually in Q1 thanks to the late-2016 launch of GoPro's Hero5 camera line and foldable Karma drone, and Q2 sales guidance of $260 million to $280 million implies 22% growth at the midpoint.

						On average, analysts polled by FactSet expect Q2 revenue of $269 million and EPS of negative $0.25. For the whole of 2017, they currently forecast revenue of $1.34 billion (up 19% from 2016, albeit still below 2014 and 2015 levels) and EPS of negative $0.12 (better than 2016's negative $1.44).

						Aiding the EPS improvement: After years of aggressive spending growth driven by fantasies of becoming a consumer hardware and content giant, GoPro has gotten serious about cutting costs. Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating expenses fell 17% annually in Q1 to $131 million, and the company expects them to be \"below $495 million\" in 2017, after totaling $708.8 million last year.

						Here's What Intel CEO Brian Krzanich Thinks About the Powerful Tech Stock Rally
						GoPro has also done a decent job of narrowing its product line: The company now sells just four consumer devices -- the Hero5 Black, Hero5 Session and Hero Session cameras, and the Karma -- along with related accessories and mounts. This serves to lower R&D costs and simplify marketing, and might also help keep inventories in check.

						But revenue growth appears set to slow in the back half of the year, in spite of GoPro's plans to launch a Hero6 camera towards the holiday season. Though the company's sales are set to rise over 20% during the first half of 2017, analysts on average forecast full-year sales will grow just 11% to $1.32 billion. Tempered expectations for the Karma are a factor: Though GoPro expects Karma to grow as a percentage of revenue in Q2, it's forecast to decline as a percentage of sales in the second half of 2017.

						Moreover, a good argument can be made that GoPro still needs to be more aggressive with its cost-cutting. In 2014, when the company posted adjusted EPS of $1.32, it had adjusted operating expenses of just $369.4 million on revenue of $1.39 billion. This year, analysts expect sales to be slightly lower, yet GoPro is effectively guiding for expenses to be over 30% higher.

						The margin pressure that GoPro is seeing also makes it unlikely that earnings will return to 2014 levels anytime soon. Whereas GoPro had an adjusted gross margin of 45.1% in 2014, its adjusted GM was just 32.3% (down 70 basis points annually) in Q1, and is forecast to be in a range of 32.5% to 34.5% in Q2. Though margins should rise in the second half due to seasonal volume growth, the price cuts the company has made to prop up camera sales remain a major headwind, more than offsetting the margin benefit the Karma is providing.

						GoPro shares surged 16% to $9.34 in after-hours trading on Thursday.

						In February, Verizon VZ, -0.72%  introduced unlimited wireless data plans, which to Evercore analyst Vijay Jayant was a clear sign of competitive pressure. Verizon’s unlimited plans are expected to be a hit on the company’s average revenue per user in the second quarter and in the long term.

						While Verizon’s wireless business is seeing customers jump ship, wireless remains roughly 70% of the company’s revenue, according to Morningstar analyst Petra Vacval. Verizon is still very much reliant on wireless.

						“Trying to pivot a tanker doesn’t happen in a quarter,” Vacval said. “Yes you’ve seen the customer declines and the stock has been beaten up, but this is a huge company with really good margins, so it’s not like they need to do something tomorrow.”

						Verizon is set to report earnings for the second quarter before the market opens on Thursday.

						Here’s what investors can expect:

						Earnings: Verizon is expected to report earnings of 96 cents per share, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet. That would be a slight improvement compared with the 94 cents the company reported during the same quarter a year ago, and the 95 cents per share reported for the first quarter. Verizon has beaten or met FactSet consensus estimates in seven of the last 10 quarters.

						Estimize, which crowdsources estimates from sell-side and buy-side analysts, hedge-fund managers, executives, academics and others, also expects Verizon to post earnings of 96 cents per share.

						Revenue: Analysts polled by FactSet expect revenue for the quarter to hit $29.86 billion, down more than 2% compared with the year-earlier period and less than 1% from the first quarter. Verizon has missed FactSet consensus in six of the last 10 quarters.

						Estimize is expecting Verizon revenue to hit $29.89 billion.

						Share price: Analysts tracking the stock have an average 12-month target of $49.08, according to FactSet, which would represent about a 12% premium to current trading levels. Analysts also rate Verizon a hold, on average.

						Google operates a little-known program to harness the brain power of university researchers to help sway opinion and public policy, cultivating financial relationships with professors at campuses from Harvard University to the University of California, Berkeley.

						Over the past decade, Google has helped finance hundreds of research papers to defend against regulatory challenges of its market dominance, paying stipends of $5,000 to $400,000, The Wall Street Journal found.

						Some researchers share their papers before publication and let Google give suggestions, according to thousands of pages of emails obtained by the Journal in public-records requests of more than a dozen university professors. The professors don’t always reveal Google’s backing in their research, and few disclosed the financial ties in subsequent articles on the same or similar topics, the Journal found.

						University of Illinois law professor Paul Heald pitched an idea on copyrights he thought would be useful to Google, and he received $18,830 to fund the work. The paper, published in 2012, didn’t mention his sponsor. “Oh, wow. No, I didn’t. That’s really bad,” he said in an interview. “That’s purely oversight.”

						The money didn’t influence his work, Mr. Heald said, and Google issued no conditions: “They said, ‘If you take this $20,000 and open up a doughnut shop with it—we’ll never give you any more money—but that’s fine.’”

						In some years, Google officials in Washington compiled wish lists of academic papers that included working titles, abstracts and budgets for each proposed paper—then they searched for willing authors, according to a former employee and a former Google lobbyist.

						Google promotes the research papers to government officials, and sometimes pays travel expenses for professors to meet with congressional aides and administration officials, according to the former lobbyist. The research has been used, for instance, to deflect antitrust accusations against Google by the Federal Trade Commission in 2012, according to a letter Google attorneys sent to the FTC chairman and viewed by the Journal.

						Last month, European regulators issued a $2.71 billion fine against Google for unfairly favoring its services over rivals’ in its search results. Google has denied the charge.

						The funding of favorable campus research to support Google’s Washington, D.C.-based lobbying operation is part of a behind-the-scenes push in Silicon Valley to influence decision makers. The operation is an example of how lobbying has escaped the confines of Washington’s regulated environment and is increasingly difficult to spot.

						“Ever since Google was born out of Stanford’s Computer Science department, we’ve maintained strong relations with universities and research institutes, and have always valued their independence and integrity,” the company said. “We’re happy to support academic researchers across computer science and policy topics, including copyright, free expression and surveillance, and to help amplify voices that support the principles of an open internet.”

						Google receives nearly $80 billion a year in ad sales drawn mostly from seven products that each attract more than a billion global users a month, including Gmail, YouTube and Google maps. Its search engine handles more than 90% of online searches globally, according to StatCounter; its Android software will run roughly 1.3 billion of the 1.5 billion smartphones expected to be sold this year, according to Strategy Analytics.

						Through its various enterprises, Google collects information that reaches deep into daily life—recording everything from users’ search history to whom they know to where they are—consumer profiles so rich that not even Google knows their full potential.

						Google has paid professors whose papers, for instance, declared that the collection of consumer data was a fair exchange for its free services; that the company didn’t use its market dominance to improperly steer users to Google’s commercial sites or its advertisers; and that it hasn’t unfairly quashed competitors. Several papers argued that Google’s search engine should be allowed to link to books and other intellectual property that authors and publishers say should be paid for—a group that includes News Corp, which owns the Journal. News Corp formally complained to European regulators about Google’s handling of news articles in search results.

						Google has funded roughly 100 academic papers on public-policy matters since 2009, according to a Journal analysis of data compiled by the Campaign for Accountability, an advocacy group that has campaigned against Google and receives funds from Google’s rivals, including Oracle Corp. Most mentioned Google’s funding.

						Another 100 or so research papers were written by authors with financing by think tanks or university research centers funded by Google and other tech firms, according to the data. Most of those papers didn’t disclose the financial support by the companies, the Campaign for Accountability data show.

						Google said in some of its funding letters that it would “appreciate receiving attribution or acknowledgment of our award in applicable university publications.” There are no professional standards on such disclosures in the research papers, which are mostly published in law journals at the universities.

						Money spent on the research measures in the low millions of dollars—according to the former employee and former lobbyist—a relatively small expense for the search-and-advertising giant. Some in academia say professors pay too high a price. Such corporate funding runs the risk of creating the impression “that academics are lobbyists rather than scholars,” Robin Feldman, of the University of California Hastings College of the Law, said in a Harvard University law journal article she co-wrote last year.

						Ms. Feldman and other critics of the funding say even disclosing money received from a company that has benefited from the research can give the appearance of a conflict of interest and undermine academic credibility.

						“Yeah, the money is good but it does get in the way of objective academic research,” said Daniel Crane, a University of Michigan law professor. He said he turned down Google’s offers to fund his research that opposed antitrust regulation of internet search engines. “If I am reading an academic paper, and they disclose an interest with a party with an interest in the outcome,” he said, “you take [the research] with a grain of salt.”

						Paying for favorable academic research has long been a tool of influence by U.S. corporations in food, drug and oil industries. Scandals involving conflicts of interest in medical research have spurred many medical schools, scientific researchers and journals to require disclosure of corporate funding and to prohibit corporate sponsors from meddling with findings.

						The tech industry now includes the world’s top five companies by market value: Apple Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc.

						Several of the companies also are active in funding academic research. Microsoft has paid Harvard business professor Ben Edelman, the author of papers saying Google abuses its market dominance. Chip maker Qualcomm Inc. funded papers supporting its side of a fight against Google over patents. And telecommunication giants Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. have funded various papers against Google. The companies either declined to comment or didn’t respond to requests for comment.

						Google’s strategic recruitment of like-minded professors is one of the tech industry’s most sophisticated programs, and includes funding of conferences and research by trade groups, think tanks and consulting firms, according to documents and interviews with academics and lobbyists.

						Google collects in-depth data from more than a billion people, and it uses the information to personalize everything from search results to YouTube recommendations to online ads. The company’s control of consumer data on such a mass scale has raised antitrust questions.

						Early last year, Daniel Sokol, a University of Florida law professor, published an academic paper arguing that Google’s use of the data was legal. “There is no cause for concern in this arena,” he wrote. The paper also noted that no companies funded the research.

						“If they did,” Mr. Sokol said in a footnote of the paper, he and his co-author “would be sipping Mai Tais with our respective friends and families on a beach in Hawaii based on the proceeds of such a sponsorship. We are not.”

						Mr. Sokol, though, had extensive financial ties to Google, according to his emails obtained by the Journal. He was a part-time attorney at the Silicon Valley law firm of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, which has Google as a client. The 2016 paper’s co-author was also a partner at the law firm, which didn’t respond to requests for comment.

						From at least as early as 2013, Mr. Sokol also has coordinated with Google officials to ensure online symposiums had a pro-Google bent.

						In March 2013, Mr. Sokol helped Paul Shaw, a Google public-policy official, persuade law professors to write papers for an online symposium on patents. Mr. Shaw sent Mr. Sokol a list of a dozen law professors along with specific topics for their papers. None was paid to participate. Mr. Shaw deferred comment to a company spokesman.

						After the conference, Mr. Sokol submitted a $5,000 invoice to Google.

						In September 2013, Mr. Sokol worked with Rob Mahini, a senior Google lawyer, to plan an online conference on a separate patent issue. Mr. Mahini identified professors to participate, and he asked Mr. Sokol to invite them.

						After running into difficulty persuading professors to write papers for the conference, Mr. Sokol asked Mr. Mahini if Google could provide “some ‘encouragement’ to them to participate,” according to the emails. Mr. Sokol declined to explain what he meant. Google said it didn’t pay professors to participate. Mr. Mahini didn’t respond to requests for comment.

						When the symposium ended, a Google assistant emailed Mr. Sokol about his bill. Mr. Sokol replied: “$5,000, like last time.”

						Asked for comment, Mr. Sokol wrote in an email: “For the symposia that I organized, I should have disclosed the sponsorship for such organization and have now done so. I disclose any financial support for the articles that I write.”

						Google and companies that make smartphones backed by its Android software have for years fought allegations of patent infringements by Oracle, Apple and Microsoft. The legal dispute has drawn academic cover on both sides.

						Google sought help from Jorge Contreras, a University of Utah law professor who has also argued for a looser interpretation of U.S. patent laws.

						Since 2013, Mr. Contreras has written numerous papers on patents. Google helped fund two of those papers, which each disclosed the financial support. The other papers didn’t mention his relationship with Google.

						Google funded a Washington, D.C., symposium in June 2015, organized by Mr. Contreras, that showcased how Google and other companies had pledged not to enforce some of their patents, allowing others to use their technology.

						Around that time, Mr. Contreras forwarded his research paper on the topic to Google policy officials and lawyers: “I would also welcome your feedback and comments,” he wrote in the email.

						“It’s in really great shape!” a Google lawyer responded. “Would be good to discuss a couple of things briefly…that are somewhat related.” They set up a phone appointment, according to the email exchange.

						Mr. Contreras said in an interview that he sent the paper as a courtesy because Google sponsored the conference. He said it was common among academics to ask for feedback on papers, including from officials at companies the papers discuss. “They’re experts and in the trenches, and I’m writing about what these people do,” he said. “So, it’s good to get feedback.”

						A month before the symposium, Google hosted a private daylong patent-law briefing at the Washington law office of Wilson Sonsini for several dozen influential public-policy advocates it hoped to win over. Google paid airfare and hotel expenses for Mr. Contreras to speak about how the company shares its intellectual property.

						Mr. Contreras said Google doesn’t pay professors to change their positions; it simply funds research that supports the company.

						“I don’t think there’s any dishonesty here,” he said, “but they pick the right people who they know are going to say the right thing.”

						In 2010, Google hired Deven Desai, then a researcher in law and technology at Princeton University, to find academics to write research papers helpful to the company.

						Over the next two years, Mr. Desai said, he spent more than $2 million of Google’s money on conferences and research papers that paid authors $20,000 to $150,000.

						In September 2012, the FTC was nearing a decision on whether to charge Google with antitrust violations, including its practice of favoring its shopping and travel services in search results. Google’s law firm, Wilson Sonsini, sent the FTC chairman an 8-page letter in the company’s defense and attached Google-funded research papers supporting its arguments.

						Mr. Desai, now a law professor at Georgia Institute of Technology after leaving Google in 2012, said part of his job was to compile a list of “all the major policy academics in intellectual property so Google lobbyists could know who to follow and potentially target for papers.”

						He said Google was careful to say the checks came with no requirements: “It was a gift. Recipients can do what they want.”

						Among the largest were $400,000 stipends that in 2010 went to several researchers investigating ways to improve users’ online privacy.

						Google and other tech companies collect personal information, including data some users would rather not share. The firms usually give notice on a privacy policies page about what is collected, and they often ask for users’ consent to keep the information.

						Some privacy advocates say the policies are long and confusing, and few people read them. The advocates seek instead rules limiting the use of personal data.

						Ryan Calo, then a research fellow at Stanford University, received one of the $400,000 awards in 2010, though he didn’t disclose the funding in one of the two papers he later published on privacy protection.

						That paper suggested finding better ways to alert consumers about exposing their personal data “before we give in to calls to abandon notice as a regulatory strategy.”

						He said in an interview that the Google money was paid to Stanford, not to him. Nonetheless, he said, he should have disclosed the financial support in both papers. After publication, Mr. Calo kept in touch with Google and shared his papers before publication, emails show.

						“I’ll be following up with a draft of that paper I mentioned on how cyberlaw is changing, and look forward to any examples or thoughts,” Mr. Calo wrote on Dec. 20, 2013, to Google officials about an idea he had on artificial intelligence, robotics and the law.

						Betsy Masiello, a Google official at the time, was copied on the email and responded: “Also let me know if you have a draft on surveillance! =)”

						Later, after seeing Mr. Calo’s research on government surveillance, Dorothy Chou, a Google spokeswoman at the time, tried unsuccessfully to arrange for Mr. Calo to discuss his conclusions on National Public Radio.

						“I’m really hoping NPR reaches out so you can get on air to make those points,” she wrote on Jan. 21, 2014. A few days later, she wrote: “We have another producer asking to chat about government surveillance, and I wanted to let you know that we pointed her your way.”

						Ms. Chou declined to comment, and Ms. Masiello didn’t respond to requests for comment.

						Mr. Calo, who is now a professor at the University of Washington, said it was common practice to discuss research with companies involved to ensure accuracy: “If you want to have impact as a scholar, you absolutely need to solicit input from the very entities you’re talking about.”

						Google officials, he said, “identify work that resonates with a position they have already, and then they amplify that work.”

						“Software is eating the world,” wrote dot-com venture capitalist Marc Andreessen five years ago, in a bullish essay published in The Wall Street Journal. About a year later, Barron’s argued that Facebook stock was no bargain at $23 (“Still Too Pricey,” Sept. 24, 2012). Software, it seems, has eaten our thesis. Facebook recently changed hands at $124.

						Wall Street analysts, on average, predict it will hit $153 in a year, for a further gain of over 20%. That looks plausible, even likely—and no, not because of a looming melt-up or dot-com bubble. Facebook is proving bears wrong and quickly growing into its valuation.

						Enlarge Image

						Photo: Blackzheep/iStock
						Consider that during the first half of this year, Facebook (ticker: FB) grew its revenue by 56% year over year. Companies typically grow more slowly as they increase in size, but Facebook’s growth was an acceleration from the first half of last year, when revenue increased 40%. First-half earnings per share more than doubled using standard accounting, and surged 89% using Facebook’s preferred math—more on that in a moment. Growth has been quickening, too, catching analysts by surprise. Facebook beat earnings estimates by an average of 22% during the first two quarters of this year, versus 5% in the same two quarters last year.

						Earnings estimates have been galloping higher. Three years ago, the handful of analysts willing to publish distant predictions guessed, on average, that Facebook would earn just over $2 in 2017. By the end of last year, the consensus had climbed to $3.78. Now more than 40 analysts forecast an average of $5.02 in earnings next year. Investors holding out for a buying opportunity in Facebook stock have watched it rise another 19% so far this year. But the 2017 price-to-earnings ratio has actually come down a smidge, from 28 at the end of last year to a recent 25. That’s based on adjusted earnings that don’t subtract for the cost of paying workers in Facebook shares. Companies must deduct that expense under generally accepted accounting principles, but they are free to supplement GAAP results with non-GAAP ones, which usually tell a more flattering story. Next year, stock compensation could cost Facebook close to $1.25 a share, or a quarter of adjusted profits.

						Betting on Tesla Motors Falling Back to Earth

						Barron’s pointed out four years ago that ignoring GAAP earnings makes Facebook look cheaper than it is, and that remains the case. But dot-com companies are highly scalable, meaning that from here, Facebook can grow revenue much faster than expenses, including stock compensation. By 2020, Wall Street predicts GAAP earnings of $8.24 and adjusted earnings of $9.64. That’s a difference of $1.40 a share, but today’s stock price looks reasonable next to either measure.

						Of course, there’s no guarantee Facebook will meet expectations, but the list of reasons for doubt is dwindling. Our early concern over the company’s ability to monetize traffic amid the shift from big desktop screens to small mobile ones now seems as relevant as a MySpace reference. Smartphones got bigger. Last quarter, mobile made up 84% of total advertising revenue, which grew 63% from a year earlier.

						Now a key investor concern is something called ad load, or the number of ads Facebook can serve up to its users. The recent acceleration in growth has been driven in part by Facebook increasing its mobile ad load. In the company’s earnings call late last month, however, its finance chief told investors to expect ad load to grow modestly over the next year, and little after that, and for that to have a negative impact on revenue growth.

						Enlarge Image

						That might be less worrisome than it seems. Facebook has other venues, including Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, which have yet to fill up on ads. By limiting ad load in its namesake app, it will limit user annoyance, which will help it grow its audience. Wall Street expects daily average users, 1.1 billion now, to reach 1.7 billion in four years. By then, Facebook will presumably have learned more about how to turn its ads into transactions, leading to growth in the rates it charges. Anyway, slowing growth seems already built in to the stock’s valuation. The consensus has Facebook’s revenue rising 51% this year, to just over $27 billion, followed by 35% growth next year, 28% in 2018, and so on. Free cash flow is nonetheless seen ballooning to $26 billion by 2020—more than what Microsoft (MSFT) generates now.

						Another concern is Facebook’s appeal to the young. Under-25s spend 10% of their mobile time on Facebook, compared with 13% for all age groups, according to comScore. Snapchat in particular is growing quickly with young users and stepping up its ad capabilities. But it still attracts just 3% of mobile minutes from under-25s, lower than the 4% enjoyed by Facebook’s Instagram, which also skews young.

						A RISE IN THE STOCK PRICE over the next year to the consensus target of $153 would leave it at 24 times the following year (that is, 2018) adjusted earnings forecast. It’s a premium price, but not an outlandish one at a time when investors are paying dearly for rare things like growth, yield and predictability. Facebook offers only one of these: growth. But General Mills (GIS) shares changed hands recently at 23 times projected earnings. Cigarette seller Altria Group (MO) goes for 21 times. Our record on Facebook forecasts is dubious, but we’re pretty sure its ad business can solidly outgrow smokes and Cheerios in coming years.

						As the tech sector looks to quickly shrug off its recent volatility, shares of social media behemoth Facebook (FB - Free Report)	gained more than 1.2% in morning trading on Monday. The stock is now sitting comfortably near the top of its 52-week range, which means it could be attractive to momentum investors looking for new highs.

						Of course, some investors tend to avoid buying at 52-week highs, but regardless, we’re all looking for stocks that are going to keep consistently climbing higher. Facebook has been one of those steady gainers over the past several years, and now, as the company is in the midst of a pivotal year for its legacy, investors are eager to see whether that growth can continue.
						So should you buy Facebook at the top of its range? Can this social media stock break even higher? Let’s take a closer look.

						First of all, we should mention that Facebook’s VGM grade of “B” implies that the stock is fundamentally sound. However, with a “D” in the Value category, FB is clearly not a value investor’s dream. Indeed, this stock tends to perfectly represent the frustrations that value-minded investors have with tech companies right now. A quick glance at Facebook’s P/E, P/S, and P/B ratios underscores this theory.
						Nevertheless, the stock also has an “A” grade for Growth. This is primarily because of its solid track record of revenue and earnings growth, as well as the fact that our consensus estimates continue to indicate growth in the current fiscal year.
						Interestingly enough, Facebook warned investors that year-over-year earnings growth rate comparisons would become more difficult, especially as the company invests in hiring new talent and developing new projects this year. Still, projected earnings growth of nearly 35% on sales growth of 40% is nothing to scoff at.
						And while it has cut into earnings growth slightly, Facebook’s recent spending has to be encouraging for long-term investors. We know that the company plans to roll out some sort of new TV show concept soon, and that new platform is on top of its new Snapchat-inspired story modes, as well as its hiring of new engineers and investments in data centers (also read: Will Facebook's TV Show Concept Crush Snap and Twitter?).
						Of course, we should also mention that Facebook is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Remember, the Zacks Rank is heavily influenced by earnings estimate revisions, so let’s check out a quick snapshot of the revision activity we have seen for Facebook recently:


						As we can see, this is a pretty encouraging revision snapshot. Current-quarter, full-year, and next-year estimates have risen significantly—with strong agreement among analysts—over the past 60 days, and while the next quarter shows slightly less agreement, our consensus estimate has still edged higher in that timeframe.
						We should note, however, that the most recent revisions seem to be holding this stock back a bit. Indeed, both the full-year and next-year Zacks Consensus Estimate has slipped over the past 30 days, and a peek at the “Upside” category of the Zacks Rank reveals that the Most Accurate Estimate—a method of tracking recent estimates—is lower for both of these periods. Nevertheless, a history of positive earnings surprises can influence the Zacks Rank positively, and Facebook has been able to surpass our earnings expectations by an average of nearly 17% in each of the trailing four quarters.
						The Zacks Rank has proven to be a useful tool in evaluating stocks, but since there isn’t a definitive indicator here, let’s see if FB’s six-month chart reveals any trends that could prove useful to recognize:

						The most glaring trend here is that FB’s 25-day moving average has acted as a support line for the stock over the past few months. However, as we should note, there have been a few short breaches of that support line. Nevertheless, these crossovers have not proven to be bearish signals in this timeframe.
						We should also note that Facebook is climbing towards its 52-week high, which it touched just before the recent tech sell-off. Given that this volatility was momentary and industry-wide, it’s tough to say whether $155 will be a strong resistance line for FB. It will certainly be interesting to see how shares behave at this level.
						Finally, we can’t mention this tech volatility without pointing to its cause. This chart illustrates a consistent, nearly interruption-free climb over the past six months, and that trend is mirrored across several other large-cap tech stocks.
						After a cautious warning from Goldman Sachs, it seemed like investors had a brief moment of hesitation about these stocks, and it was a slightly rocky week or so across the tech sector (also read: Here's Why Tech Stocks Fell Today).
						However, after months of gains, profit taking is to be expected, and at least in the case of Facebook, it does not appear that the fundamental picture has changed much. We expect the company to report earnings again on July 26—this report will be integral in determining whether Facebook can establish a new range.

						Under Armour Inc (NYSE:UAA, NYSE:UA) stock has become a bit of a “normal” stock over the past few months. A series of disastrous earnings reports sent UAA stock plunging from $47 to $20 in less than a year. But, UAA stock has stabilized since early February, generally trading around $20, save for a short-lived pop earlier this month.

						OK Isn't Good Enough for Under Armour Inc (UAA) Stock
						Source: Shutterstock
						The range-bound trading in UAA stock makes some sense. Since an ugly Q4 earnings report in late January tanked the stock, there’s been a “good news/bad news” feel toward UAA. Expectations for the company — and its growth — have come down, and Under Armour is tackling its problems head-on. At the same time, neither the apparel nor the sneaker industries look all that healthy, and external factors have weighed on UAA stock over the past few months.

						The problem for Under Armour, however, is that even after a long, steep decline, it’s still not priced for much in the way of bad news. UAA still trades at a 40x multiple to next year’s consensus EPS estimates. That seems far too aggressive and implies that UAA stock should have another leg down.

						The Good News for Under Armour
						Much of the good news for Under Armour reflects that of Under Armour stock: it’s getting back to normal. Q1 earnings were solid, albeit not spectacular. A modest, but better-than-expected, loss in Q1 led UAA stock to rally after the report, though it would soon give the gains back. Under Armour still expects full-year revenue to increase 10%+, though profits are guided to fall year over year.

						Rollouts at Kohl’s Corporation (NYSE:KSS) and DSW Inc. (NYSE:DSW) are going well (in fact, better than I expected). Kohl’s called out strength from Under Armour merchandise on its Q1 call. Both chains are providing new distribution points for Under Armour after the bankruptcy of The Sports Authority last year.

						Under Armour star Stephen Curry won the NBA title, and even the Under Armour-sponsored Maryland lacrosse team won the NCAA championship. From a public awareness standpoint, at least, Under Armour certainly is closing the gap with key rivals Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) and adidas AG (ADR) (OTCMKTS:ADDYY).

						The legalization of marijuana is destined to make millionaires out of many early investors. But don’t think you have to chase risky penny stocks to profit. These five proven companies have the scale and regulatory know-how to dominate the market. Get their names here.

						Again, there’s a sense of normalcy around Under Armour that simply wasn’t there during 2016, in particular. 2017 will be a bit of a reset year, as even UAA bulls admit. But, Under Armour seems to be laying the groundwork to re-start growth for 2018 and beyond. And, that growth could allow UAA stock to grow into a still-high valuation.

						The Problems for UAA Stock
						The key problem for UAA stock is that things like “stable” and “normal” don’t support $20+, let alone $25+. Investors may grant Under Armour 2017 as a year to regroup. But, starting in 2018, Under Armour profit needs to start growing again — and sharply — to support even the current valuation of UAA stock.

						And, there are a number of reasons to question whether that growth can come. Most notably, Under Armour’s industries don’t look all that healthy. While The Sports Authority went out of business, retailers like Dicks Sporting Goods Inc (NYSE:DKS) and Hibbett Sports, Inc. (NASDAQ:HIBB) are struggling. HIBB trades at a multi-year low, and DKS is close to it.

						Meanwhile, competition from Nike and Adidas is fierce, particularly with the continued renaissance of Under Armour’s German peer. Nike continues to emphasize direct-to-consumer sales. Its reported partnership with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) sent UAA stock down almost 4%, and with good reason, too.
